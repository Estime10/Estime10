This is just a glimpse of what I am currently working on. My journey in tech is ongoing, as I continue to refine my skills and take on new, exciting challenges. Although clients may not always see what happens behind the scenes, they definitely appreciate the impact of a well-crafted backend.

### Deepest Fear?
---

Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate,  
**Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.**  

**It is our light**, not our darkness, that most frightens us.  
You playing small **does not** serve the world.

Nothing is enlightening about shrinking  
so that other people won‚Äôt feel insecure around you.

We were **all meant to shine** as children do.  
It‚Äôs not just in some of us, it‚Äôs in everyone.

And, as we let **our light shine**, we consciously give  
other people permission to do the same.

As **we are liberated from our fear**,  
our presence automatically liberates others.

### Expectations   
---

In my current role in the tech industry, I continuously seek to be challenged and pushed to my limits. Having my back against the ropes only fuels my drive to innovate. One of the greatest parts of being a backend developer is knowing that while clients may not see the magic, they always appreciate the result.

### Together Each Accomplishes More
---

When I played basketball, I relied on my teammates to "***GO TO WAR***".  
As a unit, we overcame every obstacle.  
That‚Äôs why working as a group‚Äîno, working as a ***TEAM***‚Äîis one of the best parts of web development.  
Everyone brings unique skills and strengths to the table, which is crucial for the success of any project.

### Working as a Team:
- Helps you finish your work on time.
- Helps you discover new things.
- Creates a network that is important for the future.
