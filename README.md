I know it might seem crazy but I would like to master as many languages as I can.


### Deepest Fear?
---
Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate,
**Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.**

**It is our light**, not our darkness, that most frightens us.
You playing small **does not** serve the world.

Nothing is enlightening about shrinking
so that other people won‚Äôt feel insecure around you.

We were **all meant to shine** as children do.
It‚Äôs not just in some of us, it‚Äôs in everyone.

And, as we let **our light shine**, we consciously give
other people's permission to do the same.

As **we are liberated from our fear**,
our presence automatically liberates others.


### Expectations   
---
With this training, I am looking forward to be challenged pushed to the limits and having my back against the ropes. 
My opinion is that one of the greatest parts of being a backend is that clients my not see what you do but they enjoy 
having you!




### Team Work
---

##### Together
##### Everyone
##### Acomplish
##### More  


When I was playing basketball. I used to rely on my teammates to "***GO TO WAR***"
As a unit, we can go true all the obstacles.
And that's the reason why working as a group ... No working as a ***TEAM*** is one of the best
Parts of web development because we all have skills and assets that can help in the project we will work on.

### Working as a group
- Helps you finish your work on time 
- Helps you discover new things 
- Creates a network that is important for the future
