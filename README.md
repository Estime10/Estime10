# **Estime Vangu**

## **Full-Stack Web & Mobile Developer**

> **From professional sports to product-driven development**
> Former professional basketball player turned full-stack developer, I bring the same discipline, focus, and team mindset from the court into building high-quality digital products.

Since **2022**, I’ve been designing and developing **web and mobile applications** end-to-end — from **database architecture** and **API design** to **modern UI/UX** and **production-ready deployments**.

Today, my work sits at the intersection of **engineering, design, and performance**. I specialize in building **clean, scalable, and user-centric products** with strong attention to detail and long-term maintainability.

## **The TEAM Philosophy**

### **Together Each Accomplishes More**

Basketball taught me a core truth that applies perfectly to tech: **no meaningful success is achieved alone**.

* **T**ogether — Shared goals create stronger outcomes
* **E**ach — Every individual brings unique value
* **A**ccomplishes — Collaboration multiplies impact
* **M**ore — The whole is always greater than the sum of its parts

Whether it’s product strategy, debugging, or shipping to production, I value **clear communication, trust, and collective ownership**.

> *“If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.”*

## **Looking Ahead**

I’m continuously building, learning, and refining my craft. My focus is on:

* High-quality **web & mobile products**
* **Scalable architectures**
* **Elegant, performant user experiences**

If you’re looking for a developer who can **translate ideas into reliable, well-designed products**, let’s connect and build something meaningful.
